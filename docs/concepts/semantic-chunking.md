# Semantic Chunking

**Semantic Chunkers** are tools or methods used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to break down large text documents into smaller, semantically meaningful pieces or "chunks." These chunks are typically more coherent than arbitrary text splits (like splitting by a fixed number of characters or sentences) and aim to maintain the integrity of the meaning within each chunk. The purpose of semantic chunking is to make text easier to process, index, or retrieve relevant information, especially in tasks like document retrieval, summarization, or question-answering.

### Key Characteristics of Semantic Chunkers:

1.  **Context Preservation:** The chunks are formed in a way that preserves the context and meaning of the text, avoiding breaks that could disrupt the coherence of the information.
2.  **Variable Length:** Unlike fixed-size chunking, semantic chunking allows for variable-length chunks that are determined by the natural breaks in the content, such as paragraphs, sections, or discourse markers.
3.  **Content-Aware:** Semantic chunkers often use NLP techniques such as topic modeling, sentence embeddings, or other methods to determine the best points to split the text.

### Support in **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex**:

-   **LangChain:**

    -   **LangChain** is a framework designed to help developers create applications using large language models (LLMs). It supports various text processing tasks, including document chunking. LangChain has built-in tools to handle semantic chunking of documents, often through configurable methods that allow you to specify how text should be split based on content or structure. LangChain's chunkers can be tailored to handle different document types, such as splitting based on paragraphs, sections, or semantic content like topics or subtopics.
-   **LlamaIndex (formerly known as GPT Index):**

    -   **LlamaIndex** is a data framework designed for integrating external data sources with LLMs. It also supports semantic chunking by allowing users to define how to break down documents into chunks before they are processed or indexed. LlamaIndex focuses on efficiently retrieving relevant information by optimizing how documents are stored and queried. Semantic chunking is an integral part of ensuring that the index remains useful and efficient, especially for large documents or datasets.

In summary, both **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** support semantic chunking, with each providing tools or methods to ensure that documents are split in a way that preserves meaning and context, which is essential for effective processing and retrieval in LLM applications.
