# Glossary of Terms for the Med-Graph-RAG Project

#### Ablation Study

An ablation study is an experimental process used to assess the impact of different components within a model or framework. In MedGraphRAG, ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of various methods for document chunking, graph construction, and information retrieval.

#### Cosine Similarity

Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors, often employed in text analysis to compare the semantic similarity of entities. In MedGraphRAG, cosine similarity is used to link entities from user documents to medical vocabularies within the UMLS.

#### Element Extraction
Element extraction involves identifying and extracting key entities (e.g., symptoms, treatments, conditions) from medical text. In MedGraphRAG, this process uses LLM prompts to determine the name, type, and description of each entity, which are then organized into graph nodes for further processing.

#### Evidence-Based Response
An evidence-based response is a type of LLM output that includes citations and explanations grounded in credible sources. In MedGraphRAG, responses are generated by retrieving and synthesizing information from the hierarchical graph, ensuring that the answers are both accurate and verifiable.

#### Graph RAG

An architecture for combining graph representations with the RAG pattern to increase the quality of question-answering systems over documents.

Graph RAG typically begins with extracting both entities and relationships from a document.

#### Hierarchical Graph Structure
A hierarchical graph structure in MedGraphRAG refers to the multi-tiered organization of extracted medical entities and knowledge. This structure links user-provided documents to foundational medical information and dictionaries, forming a comprehensive graph that supports advanced information retrieval and synthesis.

#### LangChain

LangChain is a framework designed for building applications that use language models by chaining together multiple components. It provides tools to easily integrate language models with various data sources, allowing developers to construct complex pipelines that can handle tasks such as data retrieval, manipulation, and output generation in a coherent workflow.

#### LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex is a library that facilitates the creation and management of indices for large language models, particularly focused on improving search and retrieval tasks. It enables efficient querying and manipulation of text data within large datasets, enhancing the ability of language models to find relevant information quickly and accurately.

#### Large Language Model (LLM)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model that processes and generates human-like text by leveraging vast datasets and deep learning techniques. LLMs, such as GPT-4, are used for various tasks, including translation, content generation, and answering complex queries.

#### Medical Graph RAG (MedGraphRAG)

Medical Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MedGraphRAG) is a framework designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating graph-based retrieval to handle private medical data. It structures medical documents into hierarchical graphs that support precise information retrieval and evidence-based response generation, aimed at improving safety and reliability in medical applications.

#### MedMCQA

MedMCQA is a dataset of multiple-choice questions based on Indian medical school entrance exams. It is used to test the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of medical question-answering models, including those enhanced by MedGraphRAG.

#### Meta-Graph
A meta-graph is a smaller, foundational graph structure within MedGraphRAG that represents relationships between entities extracted from individual document chunks. These meta-graphs are later merged to form a comprehensive global graph for more effective information retrieval.

#### PubMedQA
PubMedQA is a biomedical question-answering dataset derived from PubMed abstracts, designed to evaluate the performance of models in addressing research questions through multiple-choice formats. It serves as one of the benchmarks for testing MedGraphRAG.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method where LLMs enhance their responses by retrieving relevant information from specific datasets. This approach allows models to provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers by grounding their outputs in retrieved evidence.

#### Semantic Document Segmentation
Semantic document segmentation is a process used to divide large medical documents into contextually coherent chunks. This method uses a combination of static character separation and topic-based segmentation to ensure that each chunk accurately represents a distinct theme or subject matter.

#### U-retrieve
U-retrieve is a retrieval strategy used in MedGraphRAG that combines top-down query structuring with bottom-up response generation. This approach allows for efficient indexing and retrieval of relevant information from the hierarchical graph, facilitating accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

#### Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a comprehensive dataset that integrates multiple medical vocabularies to enhance the interoperability of health information systems. It provides the foundational layer of semantic relationships and professional definitions used in MedGraphRAG's hierarchical graph structure.

#### USMLE
The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) dataset comprises multiple-choice questions designed to assess medical professionals' readiness for board certification. It includes multilingual content and is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of MedGraphRAG-enhanced LLMs.
